    "# Milestone Project 2 - Blackjack Game\n",
    "In this milestone project you will be creating a Complete BlackJack Card Game in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You need to create a simple text-based [BlackJack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack) game\n",
    "* The game needs to have one player versus an automated dealer.\n",
    "* The player can stand or hit.\n",
    "* The player must be able to pick their betting amount.\n",
    "* You need to keep track of the player's total money.\n",
    "* You need to alert the player of wins, losses, or busts, etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "And most importantly:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **You must use OOP and classes in some portion of your game. You can not just use functions in your game. Use classes to help you define the Deck and the Player's hand. There are many right ways to do this, so explore it well!**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to expand this game. Try including multiple players. Try adding in Double-Down and card splits! Remember to you are free to use any resources you want and as always:\n",

    "## Game Logic\n",
    "    - Player is assigned a list of Card objects\n",
    "    - Player can either hit or stand\n",
    "    - Player total must be evaluated after hitting or standing\n",
    "    - Dealer should hit on anything below 17\n",
    "    - Need to also figure out push logic\n",
    "    \n",
    "   #### Basic flow:\n",
    "        1: dealer is dealt a card\n",
    "        2: player is dealt a card\n",
    "        3: player can stand or hit\n",
    "            hit:\n",
    "                - player is dealt another card\n",
    "                - player total will be evaluated\n",
    "                - if total > 21\n",
    "                    - Bust dealer wins\n",
    "                - else\n",
    "                    - player can hit or stand\n",
    "            stand:\n",
    "                - player total is saved\n",
    "                - dealer hits until:\n",
    "                    - hits 17\n",
    "                    - between 17 and 21 inclusive\n",
    "                    - bust\n",
    "## Card Logic\n",
    "    - Cards will have three values\n",
    "        - suit : one of four possible suits\n",
    "        - rank : the numerical representation of the card\n",
    "        - val : the value of the card once in the players hand, we will deal with aces in game logic\n",
    "            \n",
    "## Player Logic\n",
    "    - Player will have:\n",
    "        - A list of cards which is their hand\n",
    "        - A function to calculate the total of their hand\n",
    "            - Needs to be able to deal with aces\n",
    "            - Should also return the value of the total to be used in the game logic\n",
